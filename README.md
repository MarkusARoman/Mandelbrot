# Mandelbrot
Github Project a Day Streak (I)
"The Birth of Fractals"

This Mandelbrot is rendered using OpenGL based on its average z position.
It takes the average z position as a vector and finds the corresponding pixel on Sandro Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus."

This project uses The Birth of Venus (c. 1486), which contains artistic nudity. This artwork is globally recognized as a cultural treasure, studied in museums, art history courses, and philosophy of beauty. Its use here is strictly artistic and symbolic, not gratuitous or provocative. My program intends to explore the beauty of math when combined with art. My intention is not to display profanity or participate in such.
